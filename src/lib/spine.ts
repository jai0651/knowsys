/* ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Chapter archetypes.

   One spine for every chapter produced sixteen chapters with byte-identical
   section lists. That reads as a template even when each sentence is fine, so
   the shape is now chosen per chapter from four options.

   `cmd` is the shell line above each heading. Not decoration: on a systems
   site `perf stat ./bench` says what the section contains more precisely than
   the word "Cost" does, and the commands differ per archetype so two chapters
   of different kinds do not open the same way.
